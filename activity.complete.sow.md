Activity Overview
In this activity, you will apply what you have learned about procurement value to complete a Statement of Work (SoW).

An SoW is a document that lays out the products and services a vendor or contractor will provide for the organization. It also describes what the contractor needs to perform the agreed-upon services. 

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work. You will not be able to access the exemplar until you have completed this activity. 

Scenario

Review the scenario below. Then follow the step-by-step instructions.

As part of the Plant Pals Operations and Training plan, you selected a vendor to install supply chain management software and equipment. In order to ensure the vendor can successfully set up the proper systems, you need to prepare a Statement of Work (SoW). 

For this engagement, the SoW should contain the following elements:

The vendor will configure inventory and fulfillment tracking software for the Office Green team. This includes auditing existing Office Green software and developing optimizations.

The vendor will also install the new software on all Office Green devices and equipment (laptops, mobile devices, and hard drives).

The vendor will install fulfillment equipment in Office Green’s warehouses.

The vendor will create training manuals and a maintenance guide for the software and equipment.

The vendor will meet with the Training Manager and the HR Specialist to explain the training manuals and answer questions. 

The vendor should complete all tasks within two weeks (10 business days).

The vendor is not responsible for training other employees or ongoing maintenance.

Office Green will pay the vendor once they have completed all of the work.

Step 2: Title the document

First, write the project name in the page header and under the Office Green logo.

Step 3: Add important stakeholders

Record important stakeholders for the project under the project name. In this case, that includes the project lead (that’s you, the project manager) and the project sponsor (the Director of Product).

Note: You won’t fill in the Revision History until you’ve drafted the SoW and shared it with stakeholders. This is where you will log changes to the SoW, so don’t forget to include it.

Step 4: State the purpose

In the Purpose section, write a sentence or two explaining the desired outcomes for the SoW. Try to be as specific as possible about your goals for working with the vendor and how they relate to the larger aims of the Plant Pals project.

Step 5: Define the scope

Next, define the project scope. Enter the major activities the vendor will complete into the Scope section.

Step 6: Define out-of-scope activities

Record activities that are beyond the contract’s scope in the Out-of-scope activities section. Defining what's out-of-scope sets expectations and minimizes potential confusion.

Step 7: Define deliverables

Describe the tangible and intangible outcomes of the vendor’s work in the Deliverables section. Make sure to be specific and consider the overall goals of the Plant Pals project.

Step 8: Add milestones

Consider the scenario carefully and break down the vendor’s work into at least three milestones. The milestones should define the major benchmarks the vendor must reach to complete the work. They are essential to tracking progress and should align with the in-scope activities. Write them in the Milestones section of the SoW. 

Step 9: Estimate time to completion

Use the scenario above to estimate the approximate number of hours the work should take. Assume eight-hour work days and five-day work weeks. 

For example, an assignment that lasts for 20 business days should take 160 hours to complete. Enter the number in the Estimated hours for completion section.

Step 10: Identify a due date

Select a date by which the vendor must complete all of the work. Calculate this date using the start date listed in the SoW header (April 12). 

Step 11: Set payment terms

It’s important for all parties to agree when the vendor will be paid for their work. Record the terms from the scenario in the Payment Terms section.

What to Include in Your Response

Be sure to include the following elements in your completed Statement of Work (SOW):

A purpose statement for the SoW

A list of in-scope items

A list of out-of-scope items

Expected deliverables

Major milestones

The estimated hours needed for completion
