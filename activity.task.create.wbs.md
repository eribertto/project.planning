Question 1
To pass this practice quiz, you must receive 100%, or 1 out of 1 point, by completing the activity below. You can learn more about the graded and practice items in the Course Overview.

Activity Overview 
In this activity, you will identify a project’s major milestones, break them into smaller tasks, and complete a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) brainstorm diagram. Then, in Part 2 of this activity, you will build on this scenario to complete a WBS spreadsheet.

Setting tasks and milestones gives you a clear understanding of the amount of work your project will require, so you can keep your project on track. Milestones also serve as great check-in points to highlight the project’s progress for your team and stakeholders.

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work. You will not be able to access the exemplar until you have completed this activity. 

Scenario

Review the scenario below. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

As a project manager for Office Green, your job includes working with the operations team to develop and implement an Operations and Training plan. Your team will use this plan for ongoing maintenance of the Plant Pals service. It will take six months to fully implement all protocols, including setting up operational tools, putting delivery processes in place, and training employees. The project will begin before the Plant Pals launch and extend beyond it.

The Operations team is responsible for managing the organization’s day-to-day business so that it continues to run smoothly. Operations provides resources to other departments, ensures consistency, and maintains the company’s profitability. The Chief Operations Officer (COO) typically leads the Operations team and works closely with other divisions, such as Sales, Client Services, Human Resources, Information Technology (IT), as well as the project manager. 

Developing the Operations and Training plan marks a new stage of the project, with its own set of goals and deliverables. After assessing the requirements for the plan you determine three major milestones:

Establish a plant delivery and logistics plan

Select and install supply chain management software and equipment

Develop and launch an employee training program

For each milestone, you divide the work into three separate tasks. Each task has its own owner, duration, and details. The tasks associated with your milestones include: 

Establish a plant delivery and logistics plan: Team members will need to source materials for packaging and hire delivery drivers. They are also responsible for calculating the delivery fees. 

Select and install supply chain software and equipment: Team members will supervise vendor setup of inventory management and fulfillment software. They must also supervise vendor installation of fulfillment equipment and determine internal safety protocols for the equipment.

Develop and launch an employee training program: Team members will need to develop training sessions, train employees to use the software and equipment, and monitor progress and improve training processes.

Step 2: Title your chart

Title your chart “Operations and Training Plan.” Giving your chart a descriptive title helps you focus on the project’s milestones and tasks.

Step 3: Add milestones

Record the three milestones from the scenario in the boxes labeled Milestone 1, Milestone 2, and Milestone 3. 

Step 4: Add tasks

Identify the tasks required to reach each milestone. Record three tasks for each milestone in the Task 1, Task 2, and Task 3 boxes. When you finish, you should have nine tasks in your brainstorm diagram—three for each milestone.

For example, one task that will help you reach the “establish a delivery plan” milestone is “hire delivery drivers."

Note: In a more detailed WBS, you would break these tasks down into additional subtasks. For example, the “hire delivery drivers” task might include subtasks like: “writing a job ad,” “interviewing drivers,” and “onboarding new hires.” For now, you can record the tasks as they are described in the scenario.

Pro Tip: Save the template
Finally, be sure to save a blank copy of the WBS brainstorm diagram template you used to complete this activity. You can use it for further practice or in your own personal or professional projects. These templates will be useful as you put together a portfolio of project management artifacts. You can use them to work through your thought processes as you demonstrate your experience to potential employers.
