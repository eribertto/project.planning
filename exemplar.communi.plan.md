Assessment of Exemplar

Compare the exemplar to your completed deliverable. Review your work using each of the criteria in the exemplar. What did you do well? Where can you improve? Use your answers to these questions to guide you as you continue to progress through the course. 

Note: Your communication plan may differ from this exemplar. That’s because communication types, frequency, and delivery methods can change depending on the situation, schedules, personal preference, etc. What should always be consistent is your attention to your stakeholders’ roles, needs, and communication styles. Learning about your team is crucial to creating an effective communication plan.

Let’s examine how the different parts of the scenario fit into the communication plan

Planning Meetings with the Core Team: Since the core team is directly involved in planning and executing the trainings, you want to meet with them daily and in person. The goal is to check in with each member about their progress, troubleshoot any issues, and make sure everyone stays on track. Your manager can also be a planning resource, so you make sure to schedule the team meetings later in the day than your weekly meeting with your manager. You make a note to check in with your manager with questions and link to the meeting agendas and notes.

Software & Equipment Vendor: Since your HR Specialist and Training Manager will plan and run the trainings, they will both need to meet with the vendor. They allow a half-day for this meeting, which will give them time to go over the training manual and ask follow-up questions. You link to the vendor’s Statement of Work and make a note to remind the HR Specialist and Training Manager to check in with relevant team members after the meeting.

Human Resources: Your HR Specialist owns communications with the HR department, and checks in with them weekly and in-person for project planning assistance. Since HR will also provide support during trainings, want to send them reminder emails as well. You note that more communications will likely be necessary on an as-needed basis.

Planning Check-ins with Facilities: Facilities needs to know the training schedule and requirements, but does not need daily updates. The Administrative Coordinator checks in with them weekly over the phone (but could also meet with them in person). You link to the forms you need to request rooms and equipment for the training sessions.

Planning Check-ins with the Print Shop: The Print Shop needs to know the details of the event, but you may not need to check in with them every day. The initial planning meeting is the most important, after which weekly check-ins (over the phone or in person) will suffice. Your Administrative Coordinator takes care of these communications. You link to the printing request forms you will use to order the training manuals.

Informational Updates for Office Green employees: You want to communicate with the trainees consistently so they remember when to arrive, where to go, and what to bring. Your Training Manager sends a group email from an official Office Green account each week and sends a reminder the day before each group’s training session. That’s a lot of messages to keep track of, so you make a note for the Training Manager to automate the reminder emails.

Training for Office Green employees: The Training Manager will also run the in-person trainings, which are scheduled each day for ten days, beginning at 10:00 AM. You make sure to link to the training schedule, so that it’s easily accessible.

Survey for Office Green employees: Once the training sessions are complete, the Training Manager will send the trainees a survey via email (with two follow-up reminders). You make a note to discuss the results at the next team meeting.

Status Update with your manager: Since your manager wants to be kept informed of your progress, you decide to update them at your weekly, in-person meeting. You make a note to come prepared with a brief update and specific questions for your manager.

Status Update with Senior Leaders: Since the Director of Operations and the Director of Product want to know how the trainings went, you send them an email update (and CC your manager) once they have concluded. You link to the resources you’ll need to create your report.
