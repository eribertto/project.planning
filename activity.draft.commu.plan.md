Activity Overview
In this activity, you will create a communication plan to help you manage all the different kinds of communication that happen during a project. Communication plans help you organize recipients, communication frequency, and the types of information you need to share.

Note: When you create a communication plan at the start of a project, don’t feel obligated to follow it exactly. Communications should be flexible enough to adapt if and when circumstances change.

Be sure to complete this activity before advancing to the next course item, which will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work. You will not be able to access the exemplar until you have completed this activity. 

Scenario

Review the scenario below. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

As part of the Plant Pals Operations and Training plan, your team will need to organize and host trainings for employees. You want to make sure that a majority of employees are properly trained to use the new software and equipment before sending the first round of Plant Pals test batches to customers. Because your employees will need to learn several different processes, training sessions will take place over a period of ten days. Your team has just over three weeks to prepare before the sessions begin.

As the Plant Pals project manager, you will work with your team to plan and execute the preparations for the training sessions. One of your tasks is to build a communication plan, which should include:

What you need to communicate (the goal of the communication)

Who needs to communicate

When information-sharing needs to happen

Why and how to communicate with everyone involved

As you begin planning the training sessions, you identify the key teams and stakeholders who will need to communicate about the event:

Core Team: Your core project team will lead the planning and task coordination. These tasks include communicating with stakeholders, preparing the schedule, reserving space and equipment, training the employees, and more.

The team members who are directly involved in organizing the trainings include:

An Administrative Coordinator who is responsible for scheduling and communicating with other Office Green teams (e.g., Facilities)

A Human Resources Specialist who manages hiring and develops training protocols (with the help of the Training Manager)

A Training Manager who reports to the HR Specialist, runs the training program on the established protocols, and refines training processes

The other members of your core project team (the Financial Analyst, Fulfillment Director, Quality Assurance Tester, and Inventory Manager) will attend team meetings and are available to pitch in if you need them.

Additional stakeholders with whom your team needs to communicate include:

Software and Equipment Vendor: Members of your team will need to meet with the vendor to learn about the software and equipment so they can create an effective training plan for employees. The team members responsible for creating and running the training program should organize and attend this meeting. Your team should allow adequate time to learn about new processes and ask follow-up questions. This meeting must take place before the end of the vendor’s SoW.

Human Resources: The Human Resources department can help your team as they develop the training plan. They will also provide support during the training sessions. Your team will want to communicate with them regularly (but not daily) and on an as-needed basis. The HR Specialist on your team is the point of contact for the rest of HR.

Facilities: Facilities will reserve and manage the spaces and equipment needed for the training sessions. They will need to review the schedule and understand your needs for each session ahead of time. A member of your team needs to keep them updated and informed of any changes to requirements.

Print Shop: The vendor who will install the software and equipment is also creating training manuals for your team. One of your team members will need to coordinate with the print shop to make copies of the manuals for each training.

Office Green employees: You will also need to coordinate with the employees who need to be trained! A member of your team should tell them where they should arrive, where they should go, what they need to bring, and communicate other necessary details. The same team member will also need to conduct the sessions and solicit feedback from employees through a post-training survey.

Your Office Green Manager: Your manager wants to be kept informed of your team’s progress but doesn't need to know every detail. They can also be a helpful resource for the planning process, if necessary. You already communicate with them regularly, so you can update them at one of your weekly meetings. 

Senior Leadership: Your manager asks you to let senior leadership know about the outcome of the trainings (and to copy them when you do so). The Director of Operations and the Director of Product (the project sponsor) want to be kept informed but don’t have much time for meetings.

Step 2: Review the communication goals and recipients

The goal and recipient of each communication is already filled out in the template. Review this information and consider the people and teams you need to coordinate. Then try to think of some ways you can effectively communicate about each goal.

Note: The first line of the communication plan has already been filled in. You can reference this information as you complete the rest of the plan.

Step 3: Determine communication types

How should you communicate about each goal? What type of communication is best for each recipient? Select one of the following communication types from the drop-down under Type of Communication:

Planning Meetings: Standard meetings with team members or stakeholders to plan event details

Planning Check-In: Brief meetings with stakeholders and support staff to discuss action items or check on task progress

Training: Sessions for employees to learn about jobs or specialized tasks

Informational update: Key details, instructions, and resources for trainees

Status Update: Timely project updates for senior stakeholders to get high-level information, give feedback, and answer questions

Note: You can use drop-down items more than once. For example, you might want to build multiple planning check-ins into your schedule.

Step 4: Determine the frequency

How often do you need to communicate with each recipient? Consider each stakeholder’s level of involvement in the project when deciding how often to communicate. Select one of the following frequencies from the drop-downs under Frequency:

Daily

Weekly

One time

Note: You can treat these frequencies as approximate since you’ll be able make note of other communications (like day-of reminders) under the Key Dates column in Step 6.

Step 5: Add the sender or owner

Who from the team should share or communicate about this information? Select one of the following options from the drop-downs under Sender/Owner:

Project Manager (you)

Core Team: Administrative Coordinator

Core Team: HR Specialist

Core Team: Training Manager

Core Team: HR Specialist & Training Manager

Step 6: Add the key dates

When should this communication happen? Are there important reminders or deadlines you should note? Consider how much time you have to plan the event and when it makes sense to communicate about each goal (e.g., early or late in the day or the week). Enter your selected times under Key Dates.

There are no right answers here, but try to be specific about times and dates—and make sure your stakeholders don’t need to be in two places at once! 

Note: Your stakeholders’ schedules will vary, and it’s unlikely that they will all be able to make every scheduled meeting. Sometimes, you will need to decide whether you need to reschedule if a key team member can’t make it.

Step 7: Determine the delivery method

How will you or your team members share this information? Should you meet in person or over the phone? Should you send a personal email or is a group message more effective? Select your delivery methods from the drop-downs under Delivery Method: 

In person

Phone call

Email (from individual address)

Email (from company address)

Note: The best delivery method for each communication depends on the needs and preferences of particular stakeholders. For this exercise, you can use your best judgment. 

Step 8 (Optional): Add resources and notes

If you’d like, fill in the Resources and Notes columns. You can consult the scenario for any important details or come up with your own. 

For example, the template includes a link to the meeting agenda and notes for daily team meetings. These documents aren’t specifically mentioned in the scenario, but they’re useful for any project meeting.

You don’t need to complete both of these fields for every communication item. Instead, try to think about what kinds of resources or information can help you reach your communication goals. 

What to Include in Your Response

Be sure to address the following elements in your completed communication plan:

The types of communication you need to have with your recipient

The recipients you need to communicate with

How often you will communicate with them

Who will own the communication (you or someone from the team)

Key dates for communication

The delivery method for each type of communication
